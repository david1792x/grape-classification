# **Grape Disease Detection using Deep Learning üçá:ambulance:üíª** 

## **Introduction**

Viticulture is the process of cultivation and harvesting of grapes. It is one of the biggest industries in the world, since it is responsible for supplying the demand for table grapes, grape juice, raisins, and more importantly, wine. Being the second most popular alcoholic beverage in the world after beer, wine is a colorful, flavorful drink that has the grape as it's backbone.

There are many wine producing regions in the world, with some of the most notable located in Europe and the United States, but if we go a little bit south of California, we can find a small zone in the municipality of Ensenada, Baja California in Mexico that supports a local, growing wine industry dedicated to wine making, research and business. Valle de Guadalupe is home to more than 100 different wineries that produce over 70% of Mexico's wine.
