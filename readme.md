# **Grape Disease Detection using Deep Learning üçá:ambulance:üíª** 

## **Introduction**

**Viticulture** is the process of cultivation and harvesting of **grapes**. It is one of the biggest industries in the world, since it is responsible for supplying the demand for table grapes, grape juice, raisins, and more importantly, **wine**. Being the second most popular alcoholic beverage in the world after beer, wine is a colorful, flavorful drink that has the grape as it's backbone, that moves a **\$300 billion** dollar industry worldwide.

There are many wine producing regions in the world, with some of the most notable located in **Europe** and the **United States**, but if we go a little bit south of California, we can find a small zone in the municipality of **Ensenada, Baja California** in **Mexico** that supports a growing local industry dedicated to **wine making, research** and **business**. **Valle de Guadalupe** is home to more than 100 different wineries that produce over **70%** of Mexico's wine. There are many varieties of grape cultivated and harvested in Valle de Guadalupe, with the most prevalent being **Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tempranillo, Nebbiolo** and **Chenin Blanc.**

In recent years, some types of **viruses** have been affecting vineyards with disease in Valle de Guadalupe, combined with an increased presence of **vine mealybugs** in this area, forming a new vector of disease among the valley. The three most notable diseases present in Valle de Guadalupe are **Pierce's disease, red blotch disease** and **grapevine leafroll disease**. These diseases are notable since they affect the vine's **leaf**, changing its color in different ways. These diseases affect the harvest of grape, since they **reduce yield amount**, cause **uneven ripening** and **change the internal chemical structure** of the grape, resulting in **impactful losses** in the production of wine in vineyards where these diseases are present.
