## **Introduction**

**Viticulture** is the process of cultivation and harvesting of **grapes**. It is one of the biggest industries in the world, since it is responsible for supplying the demand for table grapes, grape juice, raisins, and more importantly, **wine**.

There are many wine producing regions in the world, with some of the most notable located in **Europe** and the **United States**, but if we go a little bit south of California, we can find a small zone in the municipality of **Ensenada, Baja California** in **Mexico** that supports a growing local industry dedicated to **wine making, research** and **business**. **Valle de Guadalupe** is home to more than 100 different wineries that produce over **70%** of Mexico's wine. There are many varieties of grape cultivated and harvested in Valle de Guadalupe, with the most prevalent being **Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Tempranillo, Nebbiolo** and **Chenin Blanc.**
